### 5. Edge Case Tests
**Purpose**: Handle unusual or extreme conditions

#### 5.1 Boundary Conditions
- [ ] Player at exact field boundary
- [ ] Ball at exact goal line
- [ ] Zero velocity player

- [ ] Stamina = 0 (exhausted)
- [ ] Stamina = 100 (fresh)

#### 5.2 Extreme Values
- [ ] Pace = 100 (superhuman)
- [ ] Pace = 10 (very slow)
- [ ] Shot power = 100 m/s (unrealistic)
- [ ] Shot power = 0.1 m/s (tap)
- [ ] Spin = 1000 rad/s (extreme curve)
- [ ] Ball height = 100m (high ball)

#### 5.3 Error Handling
- [ ] Negative stamina (should clamp to 0)
- [ ] Negative attributes (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] NaN input (should reject or handle)
- [ ] Missing attributes (should use defaults)
