   - Offside not implemented (MVP scope)

3. **Scoring Issues**
   - Too many goals (unrealistic)
   - Too few goals (boring)
   - Goalkeepers too good/bad

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Simulation too slow
   - Memory leaks
   - Inefficient algorithms

5. **Realism Issues**
   - Possession too one-sided
   - Shots unrealistic
   - Movement unnatural
