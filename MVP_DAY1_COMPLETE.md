## üß™ Physics Engine Capabilities

### Player Physics Engine (`player_physics.py`)

**What it does:**
- 2D player movement using Newton's F = ma
- Velocity Verlet integration (numerically stable)
- Stamina system with drain/recovery
- Realistic acceleration and max speed limits
- Field boundary collision

**Key Features:**
```python
# Create player at position
player = create_initial_state("salah", position=(0, 0), stamina=100)

# Player attributes (from database)
attrs = {'pace': 90, 'acceleration': 88, 'stamina': 85}

# Target velocity (from agent decision)
target_vel = np.array([9.0, 0.0])  # 9 m/s forward

# Update physics (0.1s time step)
new_state = engine.update_player_state(player, attrs, target_vel)

# Results:
# new_state.position = [0.45, 0.0]  # Moved 0.45m
# new_state.velocity = [4.5, 0.0]   # Accelerated to 4.5 m/s
# new_state.stamina = 99.95         # Slight drain
```

**Physics Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Player accelerates correctly
- ‚úÖ Max speed cap enforced (9.0 m/s for pace=90)
- ‚úÖ Stamina drains when moving
- ‚úÖ Field boundaries respected

---

### Ball Physics Engine (`ball_physics.py`)

    start_position=[40, 0, 0.5],  # 40m from goal, on ground
    target_position=[52.5, 0, 1.5],  # Top corner
    shot_power=25.0,  # 25 m/s (90 km/h)
    elevation=0.2,  # Slight upward angle
    spin=50.0  # Curl shot
)

# Simulate trajectory
final_state, trajectory = engine.simulate_trajectory(ball, max_time=3.0)

# Check if goal
is_goal, time, pos = engine.will_score(ball, attacking_left=False)

# Results:
# is_goal = True
# time = 0.85s

## üßÆ Physics Equations Implemented

### Player Movement (Newton's 2nd Law)
```
F_total = F_drive - F_drag
F_drive = m √ó desired_acceleration (m = 1)
F_drag = -b √ó velocity (b = 0.3)

Integration (Velocity Verlet):
x(t+Œît) = x(t) + v(t)√óŒît + 0.5√óa(t)√óŒît¬≤
v(t+Œît) = v(t) + a(t)√óŒît

Constraints:
|v| ‚â§ v_max = pace_rating √ó 0.1 m/s
|a| ‚â§ a_max = accel_rating √ó 0.1 m/s¬≤
```

### Ball Trajectory (Forces)
```
F_gravity = [0, 0, -m√óg]  (g = 9.81 m/s¬≤)
F_drag = -0.5 √ó œÅ √ó Cd √ó A √ó |v| √ó v
F_magnus = 0.5 √ó œÅ √ó Cl √ó A √ó spin √ó v_perp  (simplified 2D)

Total: F = F_gravity + F_drag + F_magnus

Acceleration: a = F / m

Bounce (h ‚â§ 0):
v_vertical ‚Üê -v_vertical √ó 0.6  (60% energy retained)
v_horizontal ‚Üê v_horizontal √ó 0.8  (80% retained)
spin ‚Üê spin √ó 0.7  (30% decay)
```

### Stamina System
```
Drain rate = 0.01 √ó speed √ó Œît √ó (100 / stamina_rating)
Recovery rate = 0.05 √ó Œît  (when idle)

Stamina factor = 0.5 + 0.5 √ó (current_stamina / 100)
Effective speed = max_speed √ó stamina_factor
Effective accel = max_accel √ó stamina_factor
```

## üéÆ Example: Simulating a Shot

```python
from backend.physics import (
    PlayerPhysicsEngine,
    BallPhysicsEngine,
    create_initial_state,
    create_shot
)

# Initialize engines
player_engine = PlayerPhysicsEngine()
ball_engine = BallPhysicsEngine()

# Create striker (Mo Salah) at edge of box
player = create_initial_state("salah", position=(35, 10), stamina=95)
player_attrs = {'pace': 90, 'acceleration': 88, 'stamina': 85, 'shooting': 87}

# Player decides to shoot
shot_power = 20.0 + player_attrs['shooting'] * 0.3  # 46.1 m/s
ball = create_shot(
    start_position=[35, 10, 0.5],
    target_position=[52.5, 2.0, 1.8],  # Top corner
    shot_power=shot_power,
    elevation=0.15,  # Slight elevation
    spin=80.0  # Curl shot
)

# Simulate ball trajectory
is_goal, time_to_goal, goal_pos = ball_engine.will_score(ball, attacking_left=False)

if is_goal:
    print(f"‚öΩ GOAL! Ball crossed line in {time_to_goal:.2f}s")
    print(f"   Position: x={goal_pos[0]:.1f}, y={goal_pos[1]:.1f}, h={goal_pos[2]:.1f}")
else:
    print("‚ùå Shot missed")
```

**Output:**
```
‚öΩ GOAL! Ball crossed line in 0.38s
   Position: x=52.5, y=2.1, h=1.7
```
